# Update 2018-01-29

I had to shut down the Demo server because someone is using it to mine bitcoins. (by default, jupyter will allow anyone to create a terminal and there's no way to disable it easily.) If anyone is interested in setting it up locally, I'm glad to help.


# iSwift

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KelvinJin/iSwift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KelvinJin/iSwift)

iSwift is the kernel IPython/Notebook implementation for Swift programming language.

It can:
  + Execute swift code on the Jupyter Notebook web editor, Jupyter console as well as Jupyter qtconsole.
  + Import Foundatation/Dispatch and other Buildin libraries.
  + Autocomplete swift code by pressing tab ↹.
  + Support encryption.
  + Support Linux/macOS

## Requirements

  + macOS/Linux
  + Swift 3.0
  + ZMQ
  + Jupyter 5.0

## macOS Installation

Clone this repo locally. And:

1. Follow [this](https://github.com/Zewo/ZeroMQ/blob/master/setup_env.sh) script to install the libzmq on your machine.

2. Build the project.

```
swift build
```

3. Currently, in order to run swift kernel locally, you need to create a file named
`kernel.json`. Put the following content to the file and replace the `Path/to/iSwift`
with your local clone path.

```json
{
 "argv": ["Path/to/iSwift/.build/debug/iSwift", "-f", "{connection_file}"],
 "display_name": "Swift",
 "language": "swift"
}
```

4. Install Jupyter kernel: (replace the `Folder/that/has/kernel/json` with
  the path of the folder that contains the `kernel.json` file)

```
jupyter-kernelspec install Folder/that/has/kernel.json
```

5. Run Jupyter Notebook (token needs to be empty):
```
jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.token=
```

## Linux Installation

1. Install Swift 3.0.
2. Check if you have libzmq installed.
3. Continue from step 2 in the section above.

## Docker Installation

Simply clone this repo and run `docker build -t iswift .`. It will build the docker image.
